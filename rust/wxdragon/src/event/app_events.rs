//! Application-level events (macOS-specific)

/// Trait for handling application-level events
///
/// This trait is implemented by the App handle and provides methods for
/// registering callbacks for application-level events. These events
/// are triggered by the operating system when users interact with the
/// application in platform-specific ways.
///
/// # Platform Support
///
/// All methods in this trait compile on all platforms but may only be functional
/// on certain platforms. On unsupported platforms, the methods are no-ops.
///
/// # Multiple Handlers
///
/// Like other wxdragon event handlers, you can register multiple callbacks for the
/// same event type. All registered callbacks will be called in the order they were registered.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```no_run
/// use wxdragon::prelude::*;
///
/// wxdragon::main(|app| {
///     // Register handler for file opens
///     app.on_open_files(|files| {
///         for file in files {
///             println!("Opening: {}", file);
///         }
///     });
///
///     // Register handler for URL opens
///     app.on_open_url(|url| {
///         println!("Opening URL: {}", url);
///     });
///
///     // Register handler for app activation
///     app.on_reopen_app(|| {
///         println!("App reopened");
///     });
///
///     let frame = Frame::builder()
///         .with_title("My App")
///         .build();
///     frame.show(true);
/// });
/// ```
