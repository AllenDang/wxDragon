//! TaskBarIcon event types and data structures
//!
//! **Note**: This module is only available on Windows and Linux platforms where TaskBarIcon events are supported.
//!
//! ## Platform Support
//!
//! TaskBarIcon events have different levels of support across platforms:
//!
//! - **Windows**: Full support for all events including mouse movements, clicks, double-clicks, and balloon tooltips
//! - **Linux**: Limited support - only left down and left double-click events are available
//! - **macOS**: ❌ Not supported - macOS uses menu-based interaction only
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! For maximum cross-platform compatibility, use the `popup_menu()` method to show context menus
//! rather than relying on mouse events. The basic events (left down, left double-click) are
//! available on Windows and Linux, while Windows-specific events are only available when
//! compiling for Windows.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use wxdragon::prelude::*;
//!
//! let taskbar = TaskBarIcon::builder().build();
//!
//! // Cross-platform events (Windows and Linux)
//! taskbar.on_taskbar_left_down(|event| {
//!     println!("Left click on taskbar icon");
//! });
//!
//! // Windows-only events (conditional compilation)
//! #[cfg(target_os = "windows")]
//! taskbar.on_taskbar_balloon_click(|event| {
//!     println!("Balloon tooltip clicked");
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! # Platform Support
//!
//! TaskBarIcon events have different levels of support across platforms:
//!
//! ## Windows
//! - Full support for all mouse events (move, up/down, double-click)
//! - Balloon tooltip events (timeout, click)
//!
//! ## Linux/GTK
//! - Limited support: left down, left double-click, popup menu
//! - No mouse up/move events, no balloon events
//!
//! ## macOS
//! - No mouse events (uses menu-based approach)
//! - Events may not fire on macOS - use `CreatePopupMenu` instead
//!
//! For maximum compatibility, use `CreatePopupMenu` for menu handling rather than relying on mouse events.
