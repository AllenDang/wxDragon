/// An automatically buffered paint DC that provides flicker-free drawing.
///
/// This DC automatically chooses between wxPaintDC (on platforms with native 
/// double-buffering) and wxBufferedPaintDC (on platforms without) to provide 
/// optimal performance while eliminating flicker.
///
/// Use this instead of PaintDC for smooth animations and frequent redraws.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use wxdragon::prelude::*;
///
/// panel.on_paint(move |_event| {
///     let dc = AutoBufferedPaintDC::new(&panel_clone);
///     
///     // Clear the background
///     dc.set_background(Colour::rgb(255, 255, 255));
///     dc.clear();
///     
///     // Draw your animation content
///     dc.set_pen(Colour::rgb(255, 0, 0), 2, PenStyle::Solid);
///     dc.draw_circle(100, 100, 50);
/// });
/// ```
///
/// # Important Notes
///
/// For best results, make sure to call `set_background_style(BackgroundStyle::Paint)` 
/// on your widget during initialization. This tells wxWidgets to not erase the 
/// background automatically, which is essential for flicker-free drawing.
///
/// Also consider handling the erase background event with an empty handler to
/// prevent unwanted background erasing.
